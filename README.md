## To Install ##

1) Download the zip file and unzip it.  Open the upzipped folders and find the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file.  Double-click the TKP_Launcher.jar file to run it.

2) After the install is complete, Eclipse should open with the TKP courseware loaded. The courseware is a series of *.java files

The result should look like this: ![screenshot of Eclipse](http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-TKP-Java1.png)

=============================
### If Standard Install Doesn't Work ###

If the standard install doesn't work, then there are a couple of possible reasons: 
   
   a) You do not have Java (6 or higher) installed, if this is the case and you have Windows, then run the 'Ninite JDK Installer'. After the installer finishes, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.
   
   b) You do not have Eclipse 4.3(Kepler) installed, if this is the case and you have Windows, then run the 'Ninite Eclipse Installer'. After the installer finishes, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.
   
   if you have Mac, then you will have to install Eclipse manually.  After you are done installing Eclipse, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.

When done your dir should include

   `.git  
   .metadata  
   TeachingKidsProgramming` 

3) You do not have the correct version of Eclipse installed.  Delete the version of Eclipse you have on your system.  Then install Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) our courseware is dependant on this version because we customize the IDE as part of the courseware.  You can find Eclipse Kepler here

[Eclipse 4.3](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-43/keplerr)  

4) Open Eclipse and point it at the this directory, by going to File>Switch Workspace>Open
