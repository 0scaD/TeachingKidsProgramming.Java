TeachingKidsProgramming.Java
============================

## Install ##

1) Run the TKP_Launcher

If this doesn't work, then there are two reasons: 
1) You do not have Java installed, if this is the case, then run the 'Ninite JDK Installer'
2) You do not have Eclipse installed, if this is the case, then run the 'Ninite Eclipse Installer'

When done your dir should include

`.git  
.metadata  
TeachingKidsProgramming` 

2) Install Eclipse (unzip it)
We are using a specific version of eclipse, you can find it here

[Eclipse 4.3](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-43/keplerr)  

2) Open Eclipse and point it at the this directory
