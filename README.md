============================

## To Install ##

1) Download the zip file and unzip it.  Open the upzipped folders and find the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file.  Double-click the TKP_Launcher.jar file to run it.

2) After the install is complete, Eclipse should open with the TKP courseware loaded. The courseware is a series of *.java files

The result should look like this (our sample has two lines of code completed 'Tortoise.show();' which can you run to test to make sure everything is working if you like: ![screenshot of Eclipse](http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-TKP-Java1.png)

## To Run the Courseware ##

1) Double click the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file.  This will open Eclipse and load the TKP workspace (courseware) into the customized IDE (Eclipse editor).

=============================
### If Standard Install Doesn't Work ###

If the standard install doesn't work, then there are a couple of possible reasons: 
   
   a) Java (6 or higher) not installed -> (Win) run the 'Ninite JDK Installer'.  After the installer finishes, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.
   
   b1) Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) not installed -> (Win) run the 'Ninite Eclipse Installer'. After the installer finishes, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.
   
   b2) Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) not installed -> (Mac) install Eclipse manually.  After you are done installing Eclipse, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.

   c1a) Some old version of Eclipse installed -> (Win/Mac) Delete the version of Eclipse you have on your system by finding the folder named Eclipse and deleting it.  Then install Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler).  You can find Eclipse Kepler here

[Eclipse 4.3](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-43/keplerr)  

   c1b) Open Eclipse and point it at the this directory, by going to File>Switch Workspace>Open 

\TeachingKidsProgramming.Java

When done your dir should include

   `.git  
   .metadata  
   TeachingKidsProgramming`
