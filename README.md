============================

## To Install ##

1) Run the TKP_Launcher.jar file

2) After the install is complete, Eclipse should open with the TKP courseware loaded. The courseware is a series of *.java files

=============================
### If Standard Install Doesn't Work ###

If the standard install doesn't work, then there are a couple of possible reasons: 
   
   a) You do not have Java installed, if this is the case, then run the 'Ninite JDK Installer'
   
   b) You do not have Eclipse installed, if this is the case, then run the 'Ninite Eclipse Installer'

When done your dir should include

   `.git  
   .metadata  
   TeachingKidsProgramming` 

3) Install Eclipse (unzip it)
We are using a specific version of eclipse, you can find it here

[Eclipse 4.3](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-43/keplerr)  

4) Open Eclipse and point it at the this directory, by going to File>Switch Workspace>Open
